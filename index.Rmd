Hello,my name is Jingjing Han. I am an Associate Professor of Communication at [the School of Journalism at Fudan University](https://xwxy.fudan.edu.cn/NewsEn/). 

My research focuses on dynamic changes of cognitive and emotional processing during human-human and human-machine/media communicationï¼Œusing the complex dynamic systems framework as the primary approach. My work has been published in *Journal of Communication*, *Communication Research*, *Media Psychology*, *Communication Monographs*, and *Topics in Cognitive Science*, and reported by media outlets such as *The Wall Street Journal*.

I currently serve as the Vice Chair Elect of [the Information Systems Division of ICA](https://infosysica.org/), and Associate Editor of [*Cognitive Science*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15516709/).

I obtained my Master's and doctoral degrees from Indiana University Bloomington in United States. Before returning to China, I was a Lecturer in the Department of Communication at Santa Clara University.
