Hello,my name is Jingjing Han. I am an Associate Professor of Emerging Technologies at [the School of Journalism at Fudan University](https://xwxy.fudan.edu.cn/NewsEn/). 

My research focuses on dynamic changes of cognitive and emotional processing during human-human and human-machine/media communicationï¼Œusing the complex dynamic systems framework as the primary approach.

I currently serve the Vice Chair Elect of [the Information Systems Division of ICA](https://infosysica.org/), and Associate Editor of [*Cognitive Science*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15516709/).
